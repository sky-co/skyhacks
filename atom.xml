<p>Linux下比较常用的代码比较工具是Meld。Meld 是一个可视化的文本差异比较工具，它可以跟多个版本控制系统集成。<br>安装也极其便利：<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">sudo apt-get install update</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">sudo apt-get install meld</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>使用：<br>绿色表示没有的，蓝色表示不同的。<br>既然已经知道了不同之处，接下来就是合并了。<br>看到蓝色和绿色颜色区域的“-&gt;”和“&lt;-”箭头没，只需点一下，即可。<br>其他的一些例子和使用方法，可以参考： <a href="http://linux-commands-examples.com/meld" target="_blank" rel="external">http://linux-commands-examples.com/meld</a></p>

<h2 id="Windows"><a href="#Windows" class="headerlink" title="Windows"></a>Windows</h2><hr>
<p>Windows下主要常用的是Beyond Compare，不过这个软件是付费的。但是相比同类产品还是比较便利。<br>对于Windows下Git的用户来说，使用图形客户端进行差异比较和合并冲突比较直观，因此使用Beyond Compare作为git的比对与合并工具。</p>
<h3 id="配置"><a href="#配置" class="headerlink" title="配置"></a>配置</h3><p>打开 C:\Users\Administrator.gitconfig 文件，添加如下内容<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">[diff]</div><div class="line">    tool = bc4</div><div class="line">[difftool &quot;bc4&quot;]</div><div class="line">    cmd = &quot;\&quot;c:/Program Files/Beyond Compare 4/BComp.exe\&quot; \&quot;$LOCAL\&quot; \&quot;$REMOTE\&quot;&quot;</div><div class="line">[merge]</div><div class="line">    tool = bc4</div><div class="line">[mergetool &quot;bc4&quot;]</div><div class="line">    cmd = &quot;\&quot;c:/Program Files/Beyond Compare 4/BComp.exe\&quot; \&quot;$LOCAL\&quot; \&quot;$REMOTE\&quot; \&quot;$BASE\&quot; \&quot;$MERGED\&quot;&quot;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>(其中bc4什么的根据你安装的/Beyond Compare版本来，以上举例是Beyond Compare4)</p>
<p>也可以通过命令行来设置，命令如下：<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">#difftool 配置</div><div class="line">git config --global diff.tool bc4</div><div class="line">git config --global difftool.bc4.cmd &quot;\&quot;c:/program files (x86)/beyond compare 4/bcomp.exe\&quot; \&quot;$LOCAL\&quot; \&quot;$REMOTE\&quot;&quot;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">#mergeftool 配置</div><div class="line">git config --global merge.tool bc4</div><div class="line">git config --global mergetool.bc4.cmd &quot;\&quot;c:/program files (x86)/beyond compare 4/bcomp.exe\&quot; \&quot;$LOCAL\&quot; \&quot;$REMOTE\&quot; \&quot;$BASE\&quot; \&quot;$MERGED\&quot;&quot;</div><div class="line">git config --global mergetool.bc4.trustExitCode true</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>设置好后，使用命令是 git difftool 而不是之前的 git diff 了。</p>
<p>使用<br>差异比较<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">git difftool &lt;filename&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>合并冲突<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">git mergetool</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>

<p>If you’re interested in programming, you may well have seen this quote before:</p>
<p>“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs<br>You probably also wondered what does it mean, exactly, to think like a programmer? And how do you do it??</p>
<p>Essentially, it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.</p>
<p>In this post, my goal is to teach you that way.</p>
<p>By the end of it, you’ll know exactly what steps to take to be a better problem-solver.</p>
<p>Why is this important?<br>Problem solving is the meta-skill.</p>
<p>We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.</p>
<p>Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):</p>
<p>Try a solution.<br>If that doesn’t work, try another one.<br>If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.<br>Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.</p>
<p>The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.</p>
<p>“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.<br>Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.<br>Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report)<br>Have a framework<br>To find the right framework, I followed the advice in Tim Ferriss’ book on learning, “The 4-Hour Chef”.</p>
<p>It led me to interview two really impressive people: C. Jordan Ball (ranked 1st or 2nd out of 65,000+ users on Coderbyte), and V. Anton Spraul (author of the book “Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving”).</p>
<p>I asked them the same questions, and guess what? Their answers were pretty similar!</p>
<p>Soon, you too will know them.</p>
<p>Sidenote: this doesn’t mean they did everything the same way. Everyone is different. You’ll be different. But if you start with principles we all agree are good, you’ll get a lot further a lot quicker.</p>
<p>“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul<br>So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?</p>
<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand<br>Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).</li>
</ol>
<p>How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.</p>
<p>Do you remember being stuck on a problem, you start explaining it, and you instantly see holes in the logic you didn’t see before?</p>
<p>Most programmers know this feeling.</p>
<p>This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck).</p>
<p>“If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan<br>Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.</p>
<p>In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.</p>
<p>To get a good plan, answer this question:</p>
<p>“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”</p>
<p>Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!</p>
<ol>
<li>Divide<br>Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.</p>
<p>Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.</p>
<p>Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).</p>
<p>After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.</p>
<p>Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.</p>
<p>Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!</p>
<p>This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. Remember it (read this step again, if you must).</p>
<p>“If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.’<br>For example, suppose you’re a new programmer and you’re asked to write a program that reads ten numbers and figures out which number is the third highest. For a brand-new programmer, that can be a tough assignment, even though it only requires basic programming syntax.<br>If you’re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?<br>Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” — V. Anton Spraul</p>
<ol>
<li>Stuck?<br>By now, you’re probably sitting there thinking “Hey Richard… That’s cool and all, but what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem??”</li>
</ol>
<p>First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!</p>
<p>The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.</p>
<p>In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:</p>
<p>Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).<br>“The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer<br>Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?<br>“Sometimes we get so lost in the details of a problem that we overlook general principles that would solve the problem at a more general level. […]<br>The classic example of this, of course, is the summation of a long list of consecutive integers, 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n, which a very young Gauss quickly recognized was simply n(n+1)/2, thus avoiding the effort of having to do the addition.” — C. Jordan Ball<br>Sidenote: Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I’m serious. You’ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is.</p>
<p>Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).<br>Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.</p>
<p>Practice<br>Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!</p>
<p>Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept="" here="">.”</insert></p>
<p>How to practice? There are options out the wazoo!</p>
<p>Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, bla… bla… bla….</p>
<p>In fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing “micro problem-solving.” For example, Peter Thiel plays chess, and Elon Musk plays video-games.</p>
<p>“Byron Reeves said ‘If you want to see what business leadership may look like in three to five years, look at what’s happening in online games.’<br>Fast-forward to today. Elon [Musk], Reid [Hoffman], Mark Zuckerberg and many others say that games have been foundational to their success in building their companies.” — Mary Meeker (2017 internet trends report)<br>Does this mean you should just play video-games? Not at all.</p>
<p>But what are video-games all about? That’s right, problem-solving!</p>
<p>So, what you should do is find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy).</p>
<p>For example, I enjoy coding challenges. Every day, I try to solve at least one challenge (usually on Coderbyte).</p>
<p>Like I said, all problems share similar patterns.</p>
<p>Conclusion<br>That’s all folks!</p>
<p>Now, you know better what it means to “think like a programmer.”</p>
<p>You also know that problem-solving is an incredible skill to cultivate (the meta-skill).</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, notice how you also know what to do to practice your problem-solving skills!</p>
<p>Phew… Pretty cool right?</p>
<p>Finally, I wish you encounter many problems.</p>
<p>You read that right. At least now you know how to solve them! (also, you’ll learn that with every solution, you improve).</p>
<p>“Just when you think you’ve successfully navigated one obstacle, another emerges. But that’s what keeps life interesting.[…]<br>Life is a process of breaking through these impediments — a series of fortified lines that we must break through.<br>Each time, you’ll learn something.<br>Each time, you’ll develop strength, wisdom, and perspective.<br>Each time, a little more of the competition falls away. Until all that is left is you: the best version of you.” — Ryan Holiday (The Obstacle is the Way)<br>Now, go solve some problems!</p>
<p>And best of luck 🙂</p>
<p>Special thanks to C. Jordan Ball and V. Anton Spraul. All the good advice here came from them.</p>
<p>Also, all the programming knowledge I’ve acquired in such a short time wouldn’t have happened without Lambda School. Can’t thank/ recommend them enough.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“万丈高楼平地起，勿在浮沙筑高台.” ― 侯捷</p>
<h2 id="背景"><a href="#背景" class="headerlink" title="背景"></a>背景</h2><p>第一次见到这句话，应该是四年前读《深入浅出MFC》的时候，不知道这是不是侯捷先生的原创。<br>勿在浮沙筑高台。<br>问题一：学习是件逆人性的事，现在的生活工作节奏很快，时间都是碎片的，很容易就给自己一个借口：“没时间，太累了，想放松一下…”诸如此类的借口可以找一大堆。说实话就是“懒”。<br>问题二：书买了不少，也看了很多。大多数情况下，收效甚微。</p>
<h2 id="答案"><a href="#答案" class="headerlink" title="答案"></a>答案</h2><p>这几天耗叔的专栏开始讲如何学习的主题，对此我也是很有兴趣。因为我想知道，在同样公平的时间下，为啥别人通过努力站在一个如今我只能仰望的角度。作为一个菜鸟，大神的学习和努力的过程总是充满神秘。这篇文章也算是对这个系列的总结吧。</p>
<p>问题一解答：<br>在信息化的社会，像几十年前父辈一样，泡杯茶，端坐书桌前，摊开一本书细细品读个几个小时的生活已经一去不复返。现在生活工作节奏很快，如何利用好碎片时间提升自己，才可以在工作和生活中脱颖而出，至少比昨天的自己更进步一点。</p>
<p>问题二解答：<br>学习不是努力读更多的书，盲目追求阅读的速度和数量，这会让人产生低层次的勤奋和成长的感觉，这只是在使蛮力。</p>
<h2 id="学习的分类"><a href="#学习的分类" class="headerlink" title="学习的分类"></a>学习的分类</h2><p>人的学习分为被动学习和主动学习两种。<br>被动学习：如听讲、阅读、试听、演示，学习内容的平均留存率为5%、10%、20和30%。<br>主动学习：如通过讨论、实践、教授给他人，会将原来被动学习的内容留存率从5%提升到50%、75%和90%。</p>
<p>人的记忆都是遵循艾宾浩斯遗忘曲线的，不过艾宾浩斯遗忘曲线对我们在实践学习中能起到的用处就是告诉我们以下2点:<br>1、我们的知识的遗忘是由规律的<br>2、遗忘的速度是先快后慢；<br>观察曲线，你会发现,学得的知识在一天后，如不抓紧复习,就只剩下原来的25%。随着时间的推移,遗忘的速度减慢，遗忘的数量也就减少，得一个多月后就几乎忘得差不多了;而刚刚学习过的知识，记忆内容在80%-100%。这个遗忘规律告诉我们，要想让所学到的知识内容保持80%以上的长期记忆，只有不断地重复记忆，因为每复习一次就是记忆保持在刚刚学过的状态80%以上，多次强化后，短时记忆会形成长时记忆，就不会再忘记了。<br>通过对知识内容的多次强化复习，记忆的内容会长期保持在80%以上。</p>
<h2 id="如何才能正确高效地学习"><a href="#如何才能正确高效地学习" class="headerlink" title="如何才能正确高效地学习"></a>如何才能正确高效地学习</h2><p><strong>端正的学习态度和正确的学习观念</strong><br>学习不仅仅是为了找到答案，而是为了找到方法<br>学习不仅仅是为了知道，而更是我饿了思考和理解<br>学习不仅仅是为了开拓眼界，而更是为了找到自己的未知，为了了解自己<br>学习不仅仅是为了成长，而更是为了改变自己，改变自己的思考方式，改变自己的思维方式，改变自己与生俱来的那些垃圾和低效的算法</p>
<p><strong>总结和掌握高效的学习方法</strong><br>学习三个步骤</p>
<blockquote>
<p>知识采集<br>高质量的信息源是非常重要的，获取信息源头、破解表面新的内在本质、多方数据影子呢个，是这个步骤的关键。<br>知识缝合<br>所谓知识缝合就是把信息组织起来，成为结构体的知识。这里，连接记忆，逻辑推理，知识梳理是很重要的三部分。把知识炼成地图，将自己的理解反述出来。不断地反思和思辨，与不同年龄段的人讨论。<br>技能转换<br>通过举一反三、实践和练习，以及传授教导，把知识会转化成自己的技能。这种技能可以让你比进入更高的阶层。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h2><p>问问题也是一门艺术，其中有很多技巧，上面只是几个关键的点。在你下次问问题的时候，不妨换一个问法，相信你会有新的体验和收获。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.” ― Voltaire</p>
<h2 id="背景"><a href="#背景" class="headerlink" title="背景"></a>背景</h2><p>可能大家看到这个标题觉得很不以为然，不就是问问题么？谁不会啊！可你有想过高效正确的问对问题么？耗叔曾经写过一篇文章<a href="https://coolshell.cn/articles/10804.html" target="_blank" rel="external">X-Y Problem</a>。今天选择聊这个话题也是因为最近接手的项目周期比较赶，文档缺失，但是又需要你能快速把握整个系统，所以就需要跟很多与这个项目有关联的人打交道，这个就挺考验提问的技巧。<br>言归正传，下面就开始谈谈怎么高效地问对问题。</p>
<h2 id="为什么要问问题"><a href="#为什么要问问题" class="headerlink" title="为什么要问问题"></a>为什么要问问题</h2><p>这个好像是废话，因为不懂，因为想知道为什么，好了下一个…</p>
<h2 id="你想要的是什么"><a href="#你想要的是什么" class="headerlink" title="你想要的是什么"></a>你想要的是什么</h2><p>当你在想要问问题前，你必须先要知道你到底想要问的是什么，并且把一个问题放到一个合适的上下文环境中，这样才有助于回答者可以快速理解你的问题点并给出回答。</p>
<h2 id="如何才能正确高效地问对问题"><a href="#如何才能正确高效地问对问题" class="headerlink" title="如何才能正确高效地问对问题"></a>如何才能正确高效地问对问题</h2><p>让我们先从一个例子开始：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>你: “老板，我需要怎样做才能得到提升啊?”<br>老板:“你必须按期完成我们需要的目标！”<br>呵呵，这不是开玩笑。老板的回答的确回答了你的问题, 但是可能并不是你所期望的回答。你只能疑惑地离开，想着老板是不是对你的工作和进步不太在意?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>让我们换另一种方法:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>你: “老板, 假设我按期完成了目标，如果我想要得到提升，那么在其他方面我还需要做什么？”<br>老板: “呃，你也确实应该涉及决策部门了，而不仅仅是完成任务。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>正如你看到的，你的措辞对你得到的答复影响很大。所以，聪明的问问题方法是：把对方会显而易见的回答变成自己的陈述包含在你问的问题中。让别人顺着你“设计好的圈套”回答你想知道的答案。这就是问问题的技巧。</p>
<p><strong>问问题的场合</strong><br>不同的场合和形势下，你问问题所用的方法也会不同。不同场合需要换位思考，别人是否方便回答你的问题，比如以下几个场合就不是很方便：</p>
<ol>
<li>在别人打电话的时候；</li>
<li>—非常忙碌的时候；</li>
<li>正在休息的时候；</li>
<li>开会的时候；</li>
<li>会见客人的时候；</li>
<li>处理私人问题的时候；</li>
</ol>
<p>当然首先语言上一定要注意礼貌问题，打招呼时先说你好。这样不会引起别人的反感。<br>其次，且不说别人给出的答案是否100%正确，当别人花时间给你解释和回答了问题，结束时候记得要感谢别人，礼尚往来。</p>
<p><strong>问可供选择的问题</strong><br>这个技巧其实是很多做销售的人惯用的技巧。不要问只有“是”与“否”两个答案的问题，除非你十分肯定答案是“是”。<br>例如：不要问：“你想买双门轿车吗?”；要问：“你想要双门还是四门轿车?”<br>如果你用后面这种二选一的问题，回答问题的人就无法拒绝你。</p>
<p><strong>要问具体的内容</strong><br>不要问太泛的问题，因为这些问题的回答往往也是可有可无，你得不到有价值的答案。所以，尽量问你所关心的具体内容，有针对性的去问问题，每个问题最好都集中针对某个具体的点。<br>同时，对于问题的描述一定要言简意赅，最简单概括的语言把你的问题说出来，让人家听懂，这样也给对方一个思考的时间。</p>
<p><strong>学会聆听</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silence is golden.<br>问问题是一个相互沟通的过程，成为一个好的听众也很重要。尤其是别人正在说话或者回答问题时候，贸然的打断显得很不礼貌，同时也可能打乱别人的逻辑。</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>换位思考问自己</strong><br>花一秒钟的时间思考一下你将如何回答你将要问的问题，换位思考，假如你是对方，你会怎么回答这个问题？ 这个问题的描述是否准备，措辞是否得当？ 如果不合适，请考虑换个措辞或者修改问题的描述。<br>国外有个很著名的<a href="http://www.ituring.com.cn/article/195788" target="_blank" rel="external">橡皮鸭子解决问题法</a>, 大意就是提交问题的人应该在提问前多花点时间研究一下他们的问题，整理思路，对着一只橡皮鸭提出的问题。在提问的过程中思考，自己的问题是否是自己想要的问的东西？在这个过程中，说不定不用找别人提问，自己就有了答案。</p>
<p><strong>确认是否听懂了回答</strong><br>如果问题很重要，你必须反复确认你是否听明白了回答，你可以用下面的办法确认你听到的回答：</p>
<ol>
<li><p>重复<br>“哦，你的意思是说如果X和Y发生的话，Z就会发生。对吗？”</p>
</li>
<li><p>装不懂：<br>“好的，你可以稍微再解释一下吗（我只想确定我是否听明白了）？”</p>
</li>
<li><p>换做自己的话说：<br>“嗯，不错。如果X和Y发生的话，我应该期望Z会发生，因为…”<br>使用和回答者不同的措辞，并把你认为的话添加在后面。即使你所认为的事情可能并没有在会话中出现，但是，加上你说的话会使这场谈话更有价值。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>训练</strong><br>在问别人前，先按照以下方法向自己发问，通过平时稍加训练，有助于你成为更好的思考者。</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Focus: What specifically do I want to know? What information am I missing? Is this more than a simple YES or NO question? Am I going for deeper knowledge?</li>
<li>Purpose: Why am I asking this? Do I want to gather facts or opinions? Do I need simple clarification? Do I want to offer a different perspective?</li>
<li>Intent: How do I want people to respond? Do I want the answer to be of help to others? Am I asking to start an argument or open a discussion? Is the question superficial and not really useful or important? Am I asking out of frustration or curiosity? Do I really care about the answer? Am I willing to show respect/deference to the person I’m asking?</li>
<li>Framing: Am I using easily understandable terms and wording? Is my question neutral or does it contain bias or opinion? Is it too long or too short? Does it contain the focus of what I want to know? Does the question focus on only one thing? Is it muddled with other inquiries that don’t belong?</li>
<li>Follow-up: Do I have any more specific questions to add? Will the person I’m asking be available for other questions if need be? If I still don’t have the answer I need, what’s my plan? What can I do if I still don’t understand?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h2><p>问问题也是一门艺术，其中有很多技巧，上面只是几个关键的点。在你下次问问题的时候，不妨换一个问法，相信你会有新的体验和收获。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Remote-Code-Execution-on-a-Facebook-server"><a href="#Remote-Code-Execution-on-a-Facebook-server" class="headerlink" title="Remote Code Execution on a Facebook server"></a><a href="https://blog.scrt.ch/2018/08/24/remote-code-execution-on-a-facebook-server/" target="_blank" rel="external">Remote Code Execution on a Facebook server</a></h2><p>By Blaklis</p>
<p>I regularly search for vulnerabilities on big services that allow it and have a Bug Bounty program. Here is my first paper which covers a vulnerability I discovered on one of Facebook’s servers.<br>我经常在大型服务器中需找漏洞，并且有个bug赏金计划。这个是我的第一篇文章，其中介绍了一个我在一台Facebook的服务器上发现的漏洞。</p>
<p>While scanning an IP range that belongs to Facebook (199.201.65.0/24), I found a Sentry service hosted on 199.201.65.36, with the hostname sentryagreements.thefacebook.com. Sentry is a log collection web application, written in Python with the Django framework.<br>当我在扫描属于Facebook（199.201.65.0/24）的IP范围时，我在199.201.65.36中找到了一个岗哨服务，主机名叫sentryagreements.thefacebook.com。岗哨是一个日子收集的网络程序，基于Django framework使用python开发的。</p>
<p>While I was looking at the application, some stacktraces regularly popped on the page, for an unknown reason. The application seemed to be unstable regarding the user password reset feature, which occasionally crashed. Django debug mode was not turned off, which consequently prints the whole environment when a stacktrace occurs. However, Django snips critical information (passwords, secrets, key…) in those stacktraces, therefore avoiding a massive information leakage.<br>正当我在看这个应用的时候，不知道什么原因，一些stacktraces不时的在页面上弹出。关于用户密码重置这个特性来看，这个应用看起来很不稳定，不时的崩溃。Django debug mode并没有关闭， 结果是当stacktrace发生时，日志打印出整个环境信息。无论如何，Django抓取了一些诸如密码和秘密，还有密钥等的关键的信息</p>
<p>However, by looking at the stacktrace a little more closely, some env keys were interesting :<br>无论如何，稍微仔细看了下stacktrace，一些环境的key值非常有意思：<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">The SESSION_COOKIE_NAME is sentrysid</div><div class="line">SESSION_COOKIE_NAME是岗哨服务</div><div class="line">The SESSION_SERIALIZER is django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer</div><div class="line">SESSION_SERIALIZER是django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer</div><div class="line">The SESSION_ENGINE is django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies</div><div class="line">SESSION_ENGINE是django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies</div><div class="line">The SENTRY_OPTIONS key that contains some Sentry configuration in a list.</div><div class="line">SENTRY_OPTIONS键值包含了一些岗哨的在一个列表中的配置信息。</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Pickle is a binary protocol for (un)serializing Python object structures, such as classes and methods in them. A comprehensive article that explains what Pickle is and its security implications is available here :<br><a href="https://www.balda.ch/posts/2013/Jun/23/python-web-frameworks-pickle/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.balda.ch/posts/2013/Jun/23/python-web-frameworks-pickle/</a><br>Pickle是一个用于python对象数据结构序列化和反序列化的协议，比如其中的类和方法。一篇关于Pickle和它的安全实现的文章地址如下：<br><a href="https://www.balda.ch/posts/2013/Jun/23/python-web-frameworks-pickle/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.balda.ch/posts/2013/Jun/23/python-web-frameworks-pickle/</a></p>
<p>If we were able to forge our own session that contains arbitrary pickle content, we could execute commands on the system. However, the SECRET_KEY that is used by Django for signing session cookies is not available in the stacktrace. However, the SENTRY_OPTIONS list contains a key named system.secret-key, that is not snipped. Quoting the Sentry documentation, system.secret-key is “a secret key used for session signing. If this becomes compromised it’s important to regenerate it as otherwise its much easier to hijack user sessions.“; wow, it looks like it’s a sort of Django SECRET-KEY override!<br>如果我们可以在我们的session里包含一些任意的pickle的内容，我们就可以执行系统的命令。无论如何，stacktrace里的被Django用于单独签名的session cookiesSECRET_KEY是无效的的。无论如何，SENTRY_OPTIONS的键值里包含system.secret-key，这是逃不掉的。引用Sentry的文档，system.secret-key是用于session 签名的一个的密钥。如果这一问题被破坏，那么重新生成它是很重要的，否则就更容易劫持用户会话。wow, 这看起来就像 Django 的某个SECRET-KEY被覆写了。</p>
<p>As we have everything to forge our own cookies with arbitrary pickle content, I wrote a little script that adds a payload into my own sentrysid cookie. Here it is :<br>我们想把一切东西都融合到我们包含arbitrary pickle的cookies里，我写了一个小脚本用于添加负载到我的sentrysid cookie里。如下所示：<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">#!/usr/bin/python</div><div class="line">import django.core.signing, django.contrib.sessions.serializers</div><div class="line">from django.http import HttpResponse</div><div class="line">import cPickle</div><div class="line">import os</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">SECRET_KEY=&apos;[RETRIEVEDKEY]&apos;</div><div class="line">#Initial cookie I had on sentry when trying to reset a password</div><div class="line">cookie=&apos;gAJ9cQFYCgAAAHRlc3Rjb29raWVxAlgGAAAAd29ya2VkcQNzLg:1fjsBy:FdZ8oz3sQBnx2TPyncNt0LoyiAw&apos;</div><div class="line">newContent =  django.core.signing.loads(cookie,key=SECRET_KEY,serializer=django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer,salt=&apos;django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies&apos;)</div><div class="line">class PickleRce(object):</div><div class="line">    def __reduce__(self):</div><div class="line">        return (os.system,(&quot;sleep 30&quot;,))</div><div class="line">newContent[&apos;testcookie&apos;] = PickleRce()</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">print django.core.signing.dumps(newContent,key=SECRET_KEY,serializer=django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer,salt=&apos;django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies&apos;,compress=True)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>This code is a simple proof of concept; it takes the content of an existing sentrysid cookie, and replaces its content with an arbitrary object that will run a os.system(“sleep 30”) when unserialized.<br>这个代码是对概念的简单的证实。它获取了现存的sentrysid的cookie的内容，然后一个任意的对象替换了其中的内容，当反序列化的时候就会执行os.system(“sleep 30”)。</p>
<p>When using this cookie, the page actually takes an additional 30 seconds to load, which confirms the presence of the flaw.<br>当使用这个cookie的时候，页面就会自然等待30秒的去加载，以上证实了缺陷的存在。</p>
<p>Facebook acknowledged the vulnerability, took down the system until the flaw was patched, and then notified me about the patch being in place.<br>Facebook知道了这个漏洞，关闭了系统直到缺陷被打上补丁。然后通知我补丁已经就位。</p>
<p>Here is the disclosure timeline, which also demonstrates that Facebook security staff is reactive:<br>下面是批露的一些时间线，更证实了Facebook安全人员是被动的。<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">30.07.2018 00:00 CEST : initial disclosure with every details.</div><div class="line">30.07.2018 00:00 CEST : 初始化泄漏所有的细节.</div><div class="line">30.07.2018 15:25 CEST : triaged and system takedown.</div><div class="line">30.07.2018 15:25 CEST : 系统修复和可拆卸.</div><div class="line">09.08.2018 18:10 CEST : patch in place.</div><div class="line">09.08.2018 18:10 CEST : 补丁就位.</div><div class="line">09.08.2018 20:10 CEST : a 5000$ bounty is awarded – the server was in a separate VLAN with no users’ specific data.</div><div class="line">09.08.2018 20:10 CEST : 一个5000美元的赏金被授予——服务器位于一个单独的VLAN中，没有用户的特定数据.</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天听了《吴军硅谷来信-001封信|不做伪工作者》，感触颇多，稍微整理记录一下，分享出来。</p>
<h2 id="伪工作者的定义"><a href="#伪工作者的定义" class="headerlink" title="伪工作者的定义"></a>伪工作者的定义</h2><p>伪工作者（Pseudo Worker），来源于Google。指代一些每天应付事务性的工作的人。这些人虽然每天把自己搞得很忙，但是他们所作的工作（也被称为伪工作）并不会对公司的发展产生什么重大效果，俗称碌碌无为。</p>
<h2 id="产生条件"><a href="#产生条件" class="headerlink" title="产生条件"></a>产生条件</h2><ol>
<li>当员工对自己在公司的境遇不满，他们会消极对待工作，不自觉成为一个伪工作者。</li>
<li>一些员工总是挑些简单的事情而不是有挑战的工作去做，工作状态看上去饱和，但是实际上是在坑自己，伪工作做的越多，个人进步就越慢，甚至倒退。</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="解决方法"><a href="#解决方法" class="headerlink" title="解决方法"></a>解决方法</h2><p><strong>对于管理者</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>管理者要让员工站在“做什么事情能让公司最大收益”的基础上去工作。<br>只有这样才能让员工开始动脑筋在做不完的工作中找到那些对公司最有帮助的时期去做，而不是就简单应付老板安排的工作并交差。</li>
<li>管理者要让员工明白，他们积极工作（而不是消极完成任务），最大的受益方是他们自己。</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>对于员工自身</strong><br>一个人追求的不是完成了百分之几，或者百分之几十的工作，而是做完了那几件重要的事情。一个聪明的员工，应该善于找到最重要的工作，并且优先完成它们，产生最大化收益。而这个，恰恰是每一个新员工说欠缺的。</p>
<p>宽泛的讲，其实很多人在生活中，也是不断把时间浪费在那些可做可不做的事情上，然后收效甚微。</p>
<h2 id="反思"><a href="#反思" class="headerlink" title="反思"></a>反思</h2><p>工作很多，永远也不可能做不完。这叫要求我们要会甄别什么才是最重要的工作，可以借鉴80-20法则，往往20%的工作才是最有产出的工作，也最应该我们花时间花精力把它做好，只有这样才能称得上Smart Work。当然，找对做事情的方法后，还要做好对时间的把控。不然只是在做重复性的劳动，这样的情况，在优胜劣汰的自然界，是迟早要被淘汰的。</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>吴军的观点：</strong>在面对总也做不完的工作，主动的站在对公司业务帮助最大的角度，站在提升自己能力的角度，把那些最重要的完成了。</p>
<p><strong>罗胖的观点：</strong>面对那些可做可不做的事情，只要有时间就去做。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>愿你在工作之余还能有时间欣赏身边的风景。</p>

    <title>Tip_Week1 - Git 换行符（LF和CRLF）问题解决</title>

<p>在各操作系统下，文本文件所使用的换行符是不一样的。UNIX/Linux 使用的是 0x0A（LF），早期的 Mac OS 使用的是0x0D（CR），后来的 OS X 在更换内核后与 UNIX 保持一致了。但 DOS/Windows 一直使用 0x0D0A（CRLF）作为换行符。Git提供了一个“换行符自动转换”功能。这个功能默认处于“自动模式”，当你在签出文件时，它试图将 UNIX 换行符（LF）替换为 Windows 的换行符（CRLF）；当你在提交文件时，它又试图将 CRLF 替换为 LF。Git 的“换行符自动转换”功能听起来似乎很智能、很贴心，因为它试图一方面保持仓库内文件的一致性（UNIX 风格），一方面又保证本地文件的兼容性（Windows 风格）。但遗憾的是，这个功能是有 bug 的，而且在短期内都不太可能会修正。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-Was-Elon-Musk-Thinking"><a href="#What-Was-Elon-Musk-Thinking" class="headerlink" title="What Was Elon Musk Thinking?"></a><a href="https://medium.com/the-new-york-times/what-was-elon-musk-thinking-8166da03f1cc" target="_blank" rel="external">What Was Elon Musk Thinking?</a></h2><p>By James B. Stewart</p>
<p>There’s no question that Elon Musk is one of the great entrepreneurs of this era. He may even be in “a class of one,” as he recently described Tesla, the revolutionary electric car company he founded.<br>毫无疑问，埃隆·马斯克是这个时代最伟大的企业家之一。他甚至也可能是那一类人，他最近提及他创立的革命性的电动汽车公司特斯拉。</p>
<p>But Musk’s tweet last week — expressing his intent to take Tesla private and declaring that he had “funding secured” for the multibillion-dollar transaction — was so impulsive, potentially inaccurate, poorly worded and thought out, and with such potentially dire consequences for himself, Tesla and its shareholders, that the board now must ask a sensitive but vital question: What was Musk’s state of mind when he wrote it?<br>但就在马斯克上周在推特上发文透露他有意将特斯拉私有化，并且声称他有足够的资金担保。推文如此冲动、可能并不准确，措辞不当并且欠缺考虑，对他自己造成了潜在的可怕的后果。特斯拉的股东还有董事此刻一定想问一个敏感但是至关重要的问题：“马斯克在写这些话的时候脑子里到底在想啥？”</p>
<p>“What does this say about the judgment of the person who set all this in motion?” said Charles M. Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “That’s what the board has to find out.”<br>“这些所作所为到底说明了什么？”， 特拉华州大学的温伯格公司管理中心的主管Charles M. Elson这么说道，“这也正是董事会想要知道的。”</p>
<p>Musk, in subsequent blog posts, has stressed that he was only trying to be as transparent with the public as he was about to be with a few major investors.<br>马斯克在后续的博客推文中强调他只是想要在和几个主要投资人在一起的时候在公众前变得透明。</p>
<p>That is a laudable goal. But there are plenty of effective, conventional methods for achieving them, which include keeping his board fully informed, consulting lawyers, and following Securities and Exchange Commission procedures before tweeting about what could be a transformative, hugely expensive corporate buyout.<br>这是一个值得赞赏的目标。但在推特上发文要做出一个颠覆性、非常昂贵的公司收购意向前，依然有很多有效并且传统的途径可以达到这些目的，比如在与董事会充分沟通、咨询律师，并且遵循证券交易委员会的程序。</p>
<p>Little if any of this appears to have happened. While Tesla directors have said they discussed with Musk the possibility of taking Tesla private in general terms, they were blindsided by the tweet and have been scrambling ever since to get the situation under control.<br>假如这一切都发生了。特斯拉的主管声称他们已经和马斯克关于将特斯拉私有化的一般条款进行过磋商，他们还是被这条推文弄得措手不及，从那以后就一直在手忙脚乱地控制局面。</p>
<p>The explanation for the tweet may be more psychological than strategic. In a Twitter exchange from last summer, Musk said he experienced “great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress.”<br>推特的文字的意义可能心理作用大于战略作用。在去年夏天一次交流中，马斯克曾经表示他体会过巨大的高潮，可怕的低谷和无情的压力。</p>
<p>Asked if he might be bipolar, he replied, “Yeah.” Then he added, “Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for,” which he later described as a “ticket to hell.”<br>当被问及他是否患有躁郁症时候，马斯克回应，“是的”。然后他补充道：“也许不是医学上认定的那样。坏的情绪总是和坏的事情有关联，所以也许真正的问题是被我所签的东西冲昏了头脑”。他后来描述为“一张通往地狱的车票”。</p>
<p>“Entrepreneurs often have a temperament and a constellation of traits that can create enormous value but are also associated with significant risks,” said Michael A. Freeman, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, whose research and practice focuses on entrepreneurs.<br>“企业家总是有一些喜怒无常和一个星座的特质，这些东西可以创造巨大的价值，但是也伴随着巨大的危险”。旧金山加州大学的精神病学临床教授Michael A. Freeman如此说道。他的研究的对象是一些企业家。</p>
<p>While Freeman said he couldn’t comment on Musk, whom he’s never treated, he said that his research and experience with clients show that entrepreneurs generally “have mental health profiles that are associated with higher levels of creativity, higher levels of energy, higher levels of risk tolerance and higher levels of impulsivity. Another way to look at impulsivity is a need for speed, a sense of urgency, higher motivation, and greater restlessness.”<br>但是Freeman说他不能对马斯克做出任何评价，因为他从未诊治过他。他研究经历显示通常患有精神病症的企业家都拥有更高水平的创造力、精力、风险承受能力和、冲动。另一种看待冲动的方式是对速度的需要，一种紧迫感，更高的动力，和更大的不安。</p>
<p>All of that would seem consistent with Musk’s Twitter habits.<br>所有这些似乎都与马斯克的Twitter习惯相一致。</p>
<p>Scott Shane, a professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University, put it more simply: “These people are just wired differently,” he said. “They’re quicker to spot and act on opportunities, but that same tendency can get them into trouble in other situations.”<br>凯斯西储大学的创业研究教授Scott Shane说的更简单：“这些人只是精力不一样，他们会更快地发现并采取行动，但同样的趋势会让他们在其他情况下陷入麻烦。”</p>
<p>These qualities may also be exacerbated by lack of sleep. Musk has said he’s been sleeping on the factory floor, skipping showers, and working extremely long hours while Tesla ramps up production of its Model 3.<br>这些品质可能因为缺乏睡眠而加重。马斯卡曾提及在特斯拉增加Model 3的产量期间，他睡在工厂的地板上，没时间洗澡，长时间的工作。</p>
<p>“There are a number of behavioral destabilizers in the world of entrepreneurship,” Freeman said, “and sleep deficiency is high on the list. The consequences can be impaired functioning, higher irritability, and judgment can be adversely affected.”<br>“在创业的世界里有很多行为不稳定的人”, Freeman 说道，“睡眠不足很常见。直接导致的后果是身体功能受损、易怒、判断可能受到不利影响。”</p>
<p>During Tesla’s most recent earnings conference call, Musk apologized to Wall Street analysts he had insulted during a previous call for asking “boring, bonehead questions.”<br>在特斯拉最近的财报会议上，马斯克为自己在上一次财报会上的无礼向华尔街分析家道歉，他当时侮辱了“无聊的、愚蠢的问题”。</p>
<p>“There are reasons for it. I’ve gotten no sleep and been working sort of 110-hour, 120-hour weeks,” he said.<br>“对此我有足够的理由。我没时间睡觉，并且一周连续工作110-120小时”，他解释道。</p>
<p>It’s also a common trait of entrepreneurs that they feel rules don’t apply to them. From their perspective, many rules “get in the way of getting things done,” Freeman said.<br>创业者普遍有一个特质，他们认为规则并不适用。“从他们的角度来说，一些规则总是阻碍把事情搞定。” Freeman说道。</p>
<p>Whatever the exact circumstances of his tweet, Musk would benefit from what Freeman calls “personal boards of directors,” something he often recommends for his entrepreneurial clients. “There are some simple strategies for dealing with impulsivity, like sleep on something overnight and get a second opinion,” he said. “If you’re hard-wired to go full speed ahead at all times, you need to create a filter for yourself to decrease those risk factors.”<br>不管他的推文的具体情况如何，马斯克将会从Freeman所说的“个人董事会”中受益。有些东西他总是推荐给他的企业客户，“有一些简单的方法用于处理冲动，比如睡一觉之后得到第二种想法”，马斯克说道，“如果你在任何时候都要全速前进，你需要为自己创建一个过滤器来减少这些风险因素”。</p>
<p>Tesla’s board should play an important role. “Balancing corporate responsibilities, and the constraints they can impose, against the creativity that made the corporation great in the first place is much more of an art than a science,” said Charles Whitehead, who leads the law, technology and entrepreneurship program at Cornell Law School. “Directors and lawyers need to credibly manage that balance, but as importantly, founders need to be willing to consult with them, recognizing that the advice — even if it slows things down — may simply reflect the realities of the day.”<br>特斯拉的董事会需要扮演一个重要的角色，“相对创造力使得企业领先来说，平衡企业责任，以及他们可以施加的约束更像是一门艺术而非科学”，在康奈尔法学院领导法律、技术和创业项目的Charles Whitehead说道。“董事和律师需要可靠地管理这种平衡， 但更重要的是，创始人意向去和他们咨询、认可简单地反映当今的现实的建议， 尽管它们可能会减缓事情发展的速度”。</p>
<p>Freeman agreed. The Tesla board and others close to Musk “need to find ways to make all the positive aspects of those strengths work for him and for us while minimizing the downside.”<br>Freeman提出，“特斯拉的董事会和其他与马斯克关系密切的人应当找到合适的方法让所有这些优势的工作成为积极方面的同时尽量减少不利方面。”</p>
<p>And Musk may want to curb his use of Twitter. “One good rule of thumb: never make important, and in Tesla’s case, complex announcements through Twitter,” Whitehead said.<br>“马斯克可能想要限制他对Twitter的使用的一个好的原则就是：绝不通过twitter上做出想特斯拉案例中的重要和复杂的通告”，Whitehead说道。</p>
<p>That may be easier said than done. Tesla’s board members have been urging Musk to stop tweeting, so far without success.<br>这可能是说比做容易。特斯拉的董事会成员一直在敦促马斯克停止推特，到目前为止还没有成功。</p>
<p>“It’s not easy for anyone to control the behavior of a grand visionary,” Shane said. “These people don’t like to be controlled.”<br>Shane说道：“要控制一个伟大的梦想家的行为并非易事。这些人从来不喜欢被控制”。</p>

<p>这道题就是已知一个字符串（最后一个字符0）和三种构成成分，判定该字符串是否合法。<br>观察三种字符串可以发现，两bits的只有10和11两种（第一个bit都是1，第二bit随意），一个bit的只有0满足。<br>转变思路后就是检查一个最后一个bit是0的字符串中是否存在单个bit是1的情况（00可以解析为2个bit的0组成）。</p>

<p><strong>代码分析：</strong><br>此题没有运用一个通用的算法，而是根据题目的特性做出解答，具体步骤就是</p>
<pre><code>1. 放置一个指针在字符串首位用于遍历
2. 每次看见0的时候，往前走1步
3. 每次看见1的时候（可以认为是发现11或者10），往前走2步
4. 假如出现单个1的时候，指针往前走2步就可能超过字符串的本身长度，这种情况就是不符合题意的case。
正常遍历是可以最终到达n-1的位置（n为字符串长度）

<p><strong>代码分析：</strong><br>此题是<a href="http://skyhacks.org/2017/11/24/LeetCode-MajorityElement">LeetCode 169. Majority Element</a>的加强版，同时要找出大于n/3的众数，难点在于</p>
<pre><code>1. 时间复杂度O(n)，空间复杂度O(1) -- 注定只能遍历元素，并且用单个变量来完成计数
2. 众数的条件是n/3
</code></pre><p>针对此题的n/3的进行深入分析，可以发现有三种情况：</p>
<pre><code>1. 不存在大于n/3的众数，第一轮结束后，第二轮check时候就会把非众数都过滤掉。
2. 只存在1个大于n/3的众数, 其余元素个数总数小于2n/3。递减(pair out)时候可以保证众数的count不为0, 第二轮check时候
就会把非众数都过滤掉。
3. 存在2个大于n/3的众数，其余元素都小于n/3。递减(pair out)时候可以保证2个众数的count不为0, 第二轮check时候
就会把非众数都过滤掉。

<p><strong>代码分析：</strong><br><a href="http://blog.csdn.net/chfe007/article/details/42919017" target="_blank" rel="external">Moore’s voting algorithm</a>是比较有意思的一个算法，在dicuss上看到的。这个算法是解决这样一个问题：从一个数组中找出出现半数以上的元素。大意是这样：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will sweep down the sequence starting at the pointer position shown above. As we sweep we maintain a pair consisting of a current candidate and a counter. Initially, the current candidate is unknown and the counter is 0.<br>When we move the pointer forward over an element e:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the counter is 0, we set the current candidate to e and we set the counter to 1.</li>
<li>If the counter is not 0, we increment or decrement the counter according to whether e is the current candidate.<br>When we are done, the current candidate is the majority element, if there is a majority.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>“投票算法”</strong><br>设定两个变量candidate和count。candidate保存当前可能的候选众数，count保存该候选众数的出现次数。<br>遍历数组num。<br>如果当前的数字e与候选众数candidate相同，则将计数count + 1<br>否则，如果当前的候选众数candidate为空，或者count为0，则将候选众数candidate的值置为e，并将计数count置为1。<br>否则，将计数count - 1<br>最终留下的候选众数candidate即为最终答案。<br>以上算法时间复杂度为O(n)，空间复杂度为O(1)</p>
<h2 id="官方解析："><a href="#官方解析：" class="headerlink" title="官方解析："></a>官方解析：</h2><p>时间复杂度: O(n2) — 蛮力法: 依次检查每一个元素是否为众数<br>时间复杂度: O(n), 空间复杂度: O(n) — 哈希表: 维护一个每一个元素出现次数的哈希表, 然后找到出现次数最多的元素<br>时间复杂度: O(n log n) — 排序: 在排序后找出连续重复出现次数最多的元素<br>平均时间复杂度: O(n), 最坏复杂度: 无穷大 — 随机算法: 随机选取一个元素计算其是否为众数. 如果不是, 就重复上一步骤直到找到为止。 由于选出众数的概率 &gt; 1 / 2, 因此期望的尝试次数 &lt; 2<br>时间复杂度: O(n log n) — 分治法: 将数组拆成2半, 然后找出前一半的众数A和后一半的众数B。则全局众数要么是A要么是B。 如果 A == B, 则它自然而然就是全局众数。 如果不是, 则A和B都是候选众数, 则至多只需要检查这两个元素的出现次数即可。 时间复杂度, T(n) = T(n/2) + 2n = O(n log n).<br>时间复杂度: O(n) — Moore投票算法: 我们维护一个当前的候选众数和一个初始为0的计数器。遍历数组时，我们看当前的元素x:</p>
<pre><code>* 如果计数器是0, 我们将候选众数置为 x 并将计数器置为 1
* 如果计数器非0, 我们根据x与当前的候选众数是否相等对计数器+1或者-1
* 一趟之后, 当前的候选众数就是所求众数. 时间复杂度 = O(n).
</code></pre><p>时间复杂度: O(n) — 位操作法: 我们需要32次迭代, 每一次计算所有n个数的第i位的1的个数。由于众数一定存在，那么或者1的个数&gt;0的个数 或者反过来(但绝不会相同)。 众数的第i位一定是计数较多数字。</p>

<p><strong>代码分析：</strong></p>
<pre><code>1. 题意为给定一个数组，数组中第i个元素的值对应着第i天的股票，你可以完成多次交易，但是每次交易只能买入一次并卖出,求进行
多次交易所能得到的最大利润。该题为Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock的加强版。
2. 与Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock类似，该题同样考查的是最大差值。只不过该题考查数组中所有相邻且递增元素
的数值之差的总和。只要第i+1天的值大于第i天的值，则可买入，求得利润（差值），遍历整个数组，得到所用差值之和即为总的利润。
负值则跳过。充分体现了DP的精髓，局部最优就是整体最优解。
3. 假设有四个数字，&quot;a &lt;= b &lt;= c &lt;= d&quot;, the profit is &quot;d - a = (b - a) + (c - b) + (d - c)&quot;。
例如[5,8,9,10],maxProfit=(8-5)+(9-8)+(10-9)=10-5=5; // 这是理想情况
假如其中有负值，则跳过这几个元素，直到获取正值，保证利润都是递增。

Determine the perimeter of the island.<br><strong>Example:</strong><br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">[[0,1,0,0],</div><div class="line">[1,1,1,0],</div><div class="line">[0,1,0,0],</div><div class="line">[1,1,0,0]]</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">Answer: 16</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:<br><img src="http://otqlqfy9h.bkt.clouddn.com/images/2017-11-17/2017_11_17_1.png"></p>
<h2 id="题目大意："><a href="#题目大意：" class="headerlink" title="题目大意："></a>题目大意：</h2><p>给定一个二维地图，1表示陆地，0表示水域。单元格水平或者竖直相连（不含对角线）。地图完全被水域环绕，只包含一个岛屿（也就是说，一个或者多个相连的陆地单元格）。岛屿没有湖泊（岛屿内部环绕的水域）。单元格是边长为1的正方形。地图是矩形，长宽不超过100。计算岛屿的周长。</p>

<p><strong>代码分析：</strong></p>
<pre><code>1. 递归函数需要注意结束条件，即边界的处理。我们关心的是grid范围内，其值为1的元素
2. 为避免重复计数，每统计一个grid[i][j]，将其值置为0
3. 由于孤岛有四个维度，元素grid[i][j]的四个方向的下一个元素坐标分别为：[(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]
4. 由于是字符数组，在dfs迭代过程中，先要判断是否存在空数组情况，即‘[]’.
